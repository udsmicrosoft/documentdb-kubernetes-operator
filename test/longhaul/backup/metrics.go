// Package backup implements the data-protection component of the long haul
// driver. It provisions a ScheduledBackup against the canary cluster and
// continuously verifies the properties that only a multi-day run can
// establish: that backups keep being produced on schedule and completing,
// and that expired backups are actually garbage-collected so the backup
// population stays bounded over time (no PVC / VolumeSnapshot accumulation).
//
// It deliberately does NOT re-verify the operator's retention *arithmetic*
// (expiredAt == stoppedAt + retentionDays*24h) — that is a pure function
// already covered by the operator's unit tests and needs no accumulation.
// The oracle here is black-box: expired backups disappear.
//
// The component runs concurrently with the operation scheduler — per the
// long-haul design, backup is deliberately NOT isolated so that
// backup-vs-topology serialization bugs surface here rather than in
// production.
